## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Understanding Route Visibility

**Every response shows the execution path:**
- **🔍 Route:** Shows which nodes were executed
- **Icons indicate source:**
  - 🗄️ = Direct SQL database query
  - 📄 = Document semantic search  
  - 📊 = Hybrid search (both SQL + RAG)

**Example:**
```
Query: "how many invoices are pending"
Response starts with:
  🔍 Route: route → query_sql → generate
  🗄️ Direct SQL database query
```

### 2. Keyword-Based Routing

**SQL Keywords** (trigger database queries):
- invoice, vendor, amount, total, sum, count
- how many, list all, show me
- paid, pending, overdue, status
- category, department

**RAG Keywords** (trigger document search):
- report, audit, analysis, summary
- growth, compliance, revenue, expense
- GAAP, quarter, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
- trend, findings, recommendations

**Pro Tip:** Mix keywords to trigger hybrid routing for comprehensive answers!

### 3. Be Specific for Better Results

❌ Vague: "Tell me about invoices"
✅ Better: "How many invoices are pending?"

❌ Vague: "What about reports?"
✅ Better: "Show me the Q4 2024 audit report"

❌ Vague: "Vendor stuff"
✅ Better: "Show me total spending by vendor"

### 4. Use Natural Language

The agent understands conversational queries:

```
✅ "How much did we spend on IT this year?"
✅ "Are there any overdue invoices I should worry about?"
✅ "What's the deal with our Q4 numbers?"
✅ "Which vendors are costing us the most?"
```

### 5. Explore Different Perspectives

**Same data, different questions:**
```
"Show me pending invoices"          → List view
"How many invoices are pending?"    → Count only
"What's the total amount pending?"  → Sum aggregation
"Which vendors have pending items?" → Vendor grouping
```

### 6. Leverage the Rich Metadata

The 250 invoices include 16 fields - ask about them!

```
✅ "Show me invoices with Net 30 payment terms"
✅ "Which invoices have PO numbers?"
✅ "What are the tax rates on our invoices?"
✅ "Show me invoices by department"
✅ "What's the subtotal vs total breakdown?"
```

### 7. Test the Routing Logic

**Force specific routes by using keywords:**

```
# Force SQL route
"Count invoices"
"Show vendor amounts"
"List pending status"

# Force RAG route
"Quarterly audit"
"Compliance report findings"
"Revenue growth analysis"

# Force hybrid route
"hello"
"general overview"
"vendor compliance"
```

### 8. Multi-Turn Conversations

While the current version doesn't have conversation memory, you can:
- Ask follow-up questions with full context
- Reference previous answers explicitly

```
First: "How many invoices are pending?"
Then:  "Show me the pending invoices from Tech Solutions LLC"
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Q1: "I asked about pending invoices but got a generic count"

**A:** Make sure to include status keywords. Try:
- ✅ "How many invoices are **pending**?"
- ✅ "Show me **pending** invoices"
- ❌ "How many invoices?" (too generic)

### Q2: "The route shows query_both but I wanted just SQL"

**A:** Your query likely had both SQL and RAG keywords. Be more specific:
- For SQL only: Use "count", "total", "list", "show me"
- For RAG only: Use "report", "audit", "compliance", "analysis"

### Q3: "I don't see any actual invoice amounts in the response"

**A:** The demo might be running without the DEEPSEEK_API_KEY. Check:
```bash
echo $DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
# If empty, set it:
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

Then restart the server:
```bash
python run_server.py
```

### Q4: "Can I ask about specific invoice IDs?"

**A:** Yes! Try:
```
"Show me invoice INV-2024-0045"
"What's the status of INV-2023-0123?"
```

Note: Current SQL query logic may need enhancement for ID-specific queries.

### Q5: "Debug logging shows in terminal but not UI"

**A:** That's intentional! Debug logs (`[DEBUG]`, `[ERROR]`) appear in:
- Backend terminal (where `python run_server.py` runs)
- Not in Streamlit UI (keeps it clean)

To see what's happening:
1. Check the backend terminal
2. Look for `[DEBUG] SQL Query for: ...`
3. See SQL results length

### Q6: "How do I know if the database has all 250 invoices?"

**A:** Ask: "What's the total number of invoices?"

Expected: `Total number of invoices: 250`

If you see `5`, the database needs reloading:
```bash
rm accounting.db
python run_server.py  # Reloads from CSV
```

### Q7: "Can I upload my own invoices?"

**A:** Yes! Use the Streamlit sidebar:
1. Click "Upload an invoice or report (PDF/MD)"
2. Select your file
3. Click "Process Document"
4. Wait for background processing
5. Query the new data!

### Q8: "How does hybrid retrieval work?"

**A:** The RAG system uses **two strategies**:
1. **Semantic Search**: Vector similarity (Sentence Transformers)
2. **Keyword Search**: BM25 algorithm

Both results are combined for better accuracy!

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Testing Route Visibility

Create a test script to see all route types:

```python
import requests

queries = {
    "SQL": "how many invoices are pending",
    "RAG": "show me the Q4 audit report", 
    "Hybrid": "hello"
}

for route_type, query in queries.items():
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/query",
        json={"query": query, "thread_id": "test"}
    )
    print(f"\n{route_type} Query: {query}")
    print(f"Response: {response.json()['response'][:200]}")
```

### Benchmarking Performance

Time your queries:

```bash
time curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "how many invoices are pending"}'
```

Expected: 1.5-4 seconds end-to-end

### API Direct Usage

Skip Streamlit and use the API directly:

```bash
# Count query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "how many invoices are pending", "thread_id": "api-user"}'

# Report query  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "show Q4 audit report", "thread_id": "api-user"}'
```

### Batch Queries (Coming Soon)

Currently single queries only. Future enhancement:
```python
# Future API
POST /batch_query
{
  "queries": [
    "how many pending?",
    "show Q4 report",
    "vendor totals"
  ]
}
```

## 🎓 Learning Exercises

### Exercise 1: Route Exploration
Ask the same question with different phrasings and observe routing:

1. "invoices pending" → Should route to SQL
2. "pending report" → Might route to RAG
3. "pending analysis" → Might route to hybrid

### Exercise 2: Data Coverage
Find the boundaries of the dataset:

1. "What's the oldest invoice?" → Should find 2022 data
2. "What's the newest invoice?" → Should find 2026 data
3. "How many vendors do we have?" → Should say 50

### Exercise 3: Hybrid Triggering
Try to force a hybrid query:

1. "vendor" (SQL keyword) + "compliance" (RAG keyword)
2. "invoice" (SQL) + "report" (RAG)
3. Generic greeting: "hello" or "hi"

### Exercise 4: Metadata Exploration
Discover all the rich metadata:

1. "What payment terms do we use?"
2. "Show me invoices with PO numbers"
3. "What tax rates appear in our invoices?"
